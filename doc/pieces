Fiasco firmware pieces
======================

The firmware for the maemo devices is composed by a set of pieces containing
the required parts to update the whole system following a partition layout
defined by NOLO on the internal flash memory.

Nokia provides a blob packed with a proprietary format called 'FIASCO'. This
blob contains the following pieces:

 - 2nd         -  for Cold Flashing
 - xloader     -  first part of nolo
 - secondary   -  second part of nolo (usb support and launches kernel)
 - kernel      -  the kernel
 - initfs      -  initial system that initializes everything and runs rootfs
 - rootfs      -  the whole system image

Some of these pieces are versioned to match board specific features
(mostly xloader and secondary ones).

To flash an initfs partition and reboot:

  $ 0xFFFF -m initfs:initfs.jffs2 -f -r

The format of the argument is [[[device:[hw-revision:]]verion:]piece-type:]file-name[%layout-file-name]

Pieces can be automatically identified by using the '-i' flag:

  $ 0xFFFF -m initfs.jffs2 -i

You can dump these pieces from the internal memory of the internet
tablet by using the mtd-utils over /dev/mtd* or just running:

  770$ 0xFFFF -e /media/mmc1

There is another way for dumping pieces with extra parameters and options,
read doc/dumping for more information.
