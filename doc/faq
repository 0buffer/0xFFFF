*) How to extract the firmware pieces from a running device?

  It is possible to dump the firmware pieces from the internal MTD to reconstruct a FIASCO image.
  To do this recompile the flasher for ARM and run this command in the device:

  # mkdir /media/mmc1/backup
  # 0xFFFF -e /media/mmc1/backup

  To dump directly into FIASCO image run:

  # 0xFFFF -E /media/mmc1/backup.fiasco
